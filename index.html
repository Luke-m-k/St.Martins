            <p id="BriefHistory">Saint Martin de Porres Catholic Church - Mugutha, was founded on the first Holy Mass, 2nd November 2003
                as the result of a consolidation of the two Small Christian Communities, namely St. Charles Lwanga and 
                St. Monica which were affiliated from St. Christopher Catholic Church - Kimbo an Outstation of the St. 
                Francis of Assisi Catholic Parish, Ruiru. <br><br>
                The first Holy Mass on 2nd November 2003 was hosted at the residence of Mr.& Mrs. Vincent Kariuki Kiwara, 
                who volunteered to host the Church until it was able to acquire its home. We thank God that our Outstation
                has grown both in numbers and development. We currently have approximately 200 families divided into sixteen (16)
                Small Christian Communities: St. Lawrence, St. Claudia, St. Marcellina, St. Isidore the Farmer, St. Matthew,
                St. John Paul II, St. Catherine of Egypt, St. Josephine Bhakhita, St. Veronica Guiliani, St. Benard, St.Anthony of Padua,
                St. Titus, St. Scholastica, and St. Gregory. <br><br>
                Two Small Christian communities were <span id="hidden-history" class="hidden">established in 2022. On 11th Dec 2022, we celebrated our outstation family that was graced
                by His Lordship Bishop George Muthaka, bishop of Garissa Diocese. Fifteen(15) couples renewed their marriage vows
                and three(3) couples received the sacra-ment of Holy Matrimony. In April 2023, eighteen(18) infants were baptised and 
                six(6) catechumens were baptized in August. Twenty-two(22) candidates received the Sacrament of First Holy 
                Communion while Twenty(20) candidates were confirmed. Holy Mass on Sundays is at 8:00 a.m. We are grateful to 
                our priests for enabling Holy Mass Celebrations on other days. CWA celebrate Holy Mass every last Tuesday of the Month in the 
                church and prayers every Tuesday in the church or in a member's home, CMA celebrate Holy Mass every second Friday of the Month
                on a rotational basis at the home of one of the members. <br><br>
                Our church, by the grace of God, is at the last stages of construction. We are currently holding a pew drive
                which is halfway through as well as constructing a perimeter wall that is in its last stages. Members of the Local Council
                Executive are Mr Bernard Mwangi(Moderator), Mr George Ruhara(Vice Moderator), Mrs. Susan Njoroge(Secretary), 
                Mr Joseph Gatheru(Vice Secretary) and Ms. Margaret Gachinga(Treasurer).</span><span><button id="show-text">...more</button></span>
